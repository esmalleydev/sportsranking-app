# Big Ten Transfer Portal Analysis

With the transfer portal starting to wrap up, I decided to see what the impact might be in the Big Ten. (Some players are still undecided.)

## First, looking at who left:

There was a 28% transfer rate: 61 players out of 214. 49 of the 61 players averaged more than 3 MPG.

- **Average MPG:** 13.6 (over 3 MPG was 16.8).
- **Average PPG:** 4.9 (over 3 MPG was 6).
- **Average ERT:** 5.4 (over 3 MPG was 6.7).
- **Average PER:** 12.6 (over 3 MPG was 15.7).
- **Average TS%:** 42.54% (over 3 MPG was 52.97%).

### Where did they go? Major conferences:

- SEC: 7
- A10: 6
- BIG 12: 5
- BIG EAST: 5
- AAC: 5
- BIG TEN: 5
- ACC: 2
- A bunch to smaller conferences

### Teams with the most transferring (over 3 MPG):

- MINN: 6
- ILL, Maryland, RUT, MICH: 5
- OSU: 4
- PSU, NEB, IOWA, IU, WIS: 3

### Teams with the least transferring (over 3 MPG):

- Northwestern: 0
- PUR, MSU: 2

## Now looking at who is coming to the Big Ten:

The Big Ten gained 48 transfers (so far). Only 2 averaged less than 3 MPG.

- **Average MPG:** 22.6 (over 3 MPG was 23.5).
- **Average PPG:** 9.4 (over 3 MPG was 9.8).
- **Average ERT:** 10.4 (over 3 MPG was 10.8).
- **Average PER:** 19.4 (over 3 MPG was 20.2).
